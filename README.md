###Project Objectives:

We commonly refer to ourselves or others as members of a specific generation. For example - I am a Millennial. But are we actually using the correct generation? I often hear people refer to generations incorrectly as they make broad generalizations about an age group. This website provides insight into the different generations we commonly reference, provide defining dates, and some common characteristics of each generation. The hope is that we can all become more educated on the different generations and use them correctly when referring to a large group of people.

One goal of this project was to give myself some time to work on my "Vanilla CSS" skills. My most recent project used React Semantic UI, so I was feeling out of touch with the basic CSS. The other goal was to create a website that was compliant with accessibility standards. I found it was so easy to get carried away with features and graphics on my other projects, that I wanted an opportunity to learn more about accessibility and to check my work.

- CSS
